ES6 
Methods are functions attached to classes
Properties are constants attached to classes
Classes are just blueprints for JS objects.

... Rest operator used in function e.g. function xyz(...args) {}  takes an unlimited number of arguments and merges them into an array.
... Spread operator used in arrays and objects will copy properties from the referenced obj/array.

Primitive types: nums, stings, booleans -> get copied instead of referenced.cd
